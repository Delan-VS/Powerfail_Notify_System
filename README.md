# PowerFailNotifySystem

A power failure alert system developed by the help of arduio and python <br>
#### Why the system is important ?
  Consider situation when power gone in a local area, What peoples normally do?.Half of peoples calls to the electricity board/provider to raise a complaint .
  This situation is making super hard for all kind of workers and user.This IOT Solution is going to simplify this problem.
  All electric post have their own ZMPT101B [AC Voltage sensor module] <br>
  when a post lost its source current the ZMPT101B Will read it. Then we can send alert message with post number to workers for quick repair

##### Needs
* proper network connection 
* Arduino
* ZMPT101B Module
* cables 
* LED if needed
